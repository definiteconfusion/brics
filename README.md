## Welcome

Brics is (eventually going to be) an active-component library for React(kinda like a bunch of widgets). Brics can be used for simple and quick information integration while each component can be molded to your product's own style. This project is very much "in development", and, as such, is not web-packed for production or distribution, if it is your prerogative, the only thing really to-do, would be to create a webpack.config.js file.

## Current Components
